# LLM Defense Framework

A comprehensive framework for enhancing LLM security through post-processing defenses and statistical guarantees.

## Overview

This project implements a novel approach to LLM security focusing on:
- Post-processing defense mechanisms
- Statistical guarantees through one-class SVM
- Adaptive policy updates
- Multimodal security evaluation

## Components

### 1. Sampling Methods
- Speculative decoding optimization
- Tree-based sampling
- Nucleus sampling with guarantees

### 2. Defense Mechanisms
- Content filtering with statistical guarantees
- Policy adaptation framework
- Real-time verification

### 3. Evaluation Framework
- Comprehensive security benchmarks
- Performance metrics
- Statistical validation
